-- Overall Summary 
-- 1. **National Trends** 

--    * The dataset spans from **2020 to 2022**, showing clear infection peaks (e.g., Jan 2022 with 76k cases in a day).
--    * Rolling averages smooth daily volatility and help spot overall waves.

-- 2. **Regional & Provincial Insights** 

--    * **Flanders dominates** with ~58% of total cases, followed by Wallonia (31%) and Brussels (11%).
--    * Within provinces, **Antwerpen leads** (784k cases), followed by OostVlaanderen and Hainaut.

-- 3. **Demographics (Age & Gender)** 

--    * The **30-39 age group** is the most affected (~823k cases), followed by 40-49 and 20-29.
--    * **Females report slightly more cases (2.63M)** than males (2.25M), but proportions vary by age group.

-- 4. **High-Impact Segments** 

--    * Antwerpen consistently tops cases across most age groups (0-9 to 40-49).
--    * Regional contributions reveal key hotspots driving local totals.

-- 5. **Strategic Insights** ðŸ’¡

--    * Policies should focus on **working-age populations (20-49 years)**, as they form the majority of cases.
--    * Regional resource allocation should prioritize **Flanders and high-density provinces** like Antwerpen and OostVlaanderen.
